# üîê Password Strength Checker in Python (Educational)

This project is a simple password strength checker designed to evaluate whether a given password is strong based on common security requirements.

## üéØ Objective

To demonstrate how password strength can be analyzed based on several criteria, such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## üöÄ How it works?

- The script prompts the user to enter a password.
- It checks for:
  - Minimum length of 8 characters.
  - At least one uppercase letter.
  - At least one lowercase letter.
  - At least one digit.
  - At least one special character.
- Returns a message about whether the password meets the security requirements or not.

## üìö Concepts Applied

- Python (Regular Expressions)
- Cybersecurity (Password Security)
- Good coding practices for string validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

> This project is for **educational purposes** only. It simulates a basic password strength checker and can be modified to suit real-world security requirements.
